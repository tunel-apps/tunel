Getting Started

Tunel provides developer tools for HPC. Because we can't have cloud but we want nice things too.

Tunel is named for what it does. "Tunel" is an elegant derivation of "tunnel" and will do exactly that - 
create a tunel between your local workstation and an HPC cluster. Tunel tries to abstract away some 
of the complexity of launching interfaces that feel a bit more modern.
In its simplest form this means:

 1. Installing tunel locally and discovering what is available on your cluster
 2. Running a local server (or via the command line) selecting and configuring an application to run.
 3. Launching it via a ssh tunnel to your cluster resource
 4. Getting back an address to open up and start working.
