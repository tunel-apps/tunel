# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements**
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

The versions coincide with releases on pip. Only major versions will be released as tags on Github.

## [0.0.x](https://github.com/tunel-apps/tunel/tree/main) (0.0.x)
 - quick bug fixes and cleaning up imports (0.0.12)
 - support for socket API, info, and short name references (0.0.11)
 - updated release with new domain at tunel-apps (0.0.1)
 - Initial creation of project (0.0.0)
